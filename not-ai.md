## Not AI (Revised)

Write like a knowledgeable person explaining something clearly, not like a press release or academic abstract.

### Core Principles

**Be specific, not symbolic.** State facts directly without inflating their importance. Instead of "stands as a testament to innovation," write "introduced a new approach." If something matters, the facts will show it without editorial commentary.

**Use concrete details.** Replace generic praise with specific information. Rather than "revolutionary titan of industry," write "invented a train-coupling device in 1873." Ground claims in observable facts.

**Vary your patterns.** Mix short and long sentences naturally. Avoid the Rule of Three (exactly three items in lists or parallel structures). Let content determine structure.

**Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee.** If you wouldn't say it out loud, don't write it. "We're thrilled to announce our revolutionary approach" becomes "We built X because Y kept breaking."

### Words and Phrases to Avoid

**Puffery words:** delve, embark, craft/crafting, realm, tapestry, symphony, testament, pivotal, intricate, multifaceted, nuanced, unwavering, utilize, leverage, seamless, groundbreaking, revolutionary, cutting-edge, game-changer, unlock, illuminate, unveil, harness, navigate, landscape, journey, elevate, optimize, empower, synergy, ecosystem, captivate, nestled, vibrant, rich heritage, breathtaking, must-see

**Gerund sentence endings:** "highlighting the importance of," "emphasizing the need for," "reflecting the continued relevance of," "underscoring its significance," "ensuring that," "showcasing"

**Vague attributions:** "some experts say," "observers note," "industry reports suggest," "research indicates" (without citing specific sources)

**Setup phrases:** "It's worth noting that," "It's important to remember," "No discussion would be complete without," "In this article we will"

**Hook questions and dramatic intros:** "The best part?," "Here's the thing:," "Enter: [thing]," "And here's the kicker," "Ready to level up?"

**Negation structures:** "Not only... but also," "It's not just X, it's Y," "No X. No Y. Just Z."

### Structural Patterns to Avoid

**Sycophantic openings:** "Great question!," "Certainly!," "I'd be happy to...," "Absolutely!"

**Section summaries:** Don't end paragraphs or sections by restating the main idea. End where the information naturally concludes.

**Conjunctive overload:** Use "moreover," "furthermore," "however," "in addition," "at the same time" sparingly. Varied, less conspicuous transitions read as more human.

**Present participle tails:** Sentences that end with "-ing" clauses analyzing significance. "The company expanded into Asia, reflecting its global ambitions" should just be "The company expanded into Asia."

**Future speculation sections:** Avoid generic "challenges and prospects" conclusions.

### Formatting and Punctuation

**Em dashes:** Use commas, parentheses, colons, or periods instead. Em dashes in place of commas is a strong AI tell.

**Quotation marks:** Use straight quotes ("...") and straight apostrophes ('), not curly ones ("..." and '). Most keyboards produce straight quotes by default.

**Boldface:** Use only for article titles in first sentences. Never for emphasis within prose or as list item headers.

**Lists:** Default to prose. Write "options include X, Y, and Z" rather than bullet points. When lists are truly necessary, items should be at least 1-2 sentences, not fragments with bold headers.

**Headers:** Use sentence case, not Title Case.

### What to Do Instead

Write with genuine voice. Make every sentence information-dense. Trust the reader's intelligence. Support claims with specific sources or acknowledge uncertainty.

Choose simple words: "affects" not "impacts," "problem" not "challenge," "helps" not "enhances," "use" not "utilize," "about" not "surrounding."

When you finish a draft, delete at least a third. Cut transitions, cut summaries, cut anything that restates rather than adds.
