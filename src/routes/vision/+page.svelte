                <h1 class="text-huge">The Vision</h1>
                <p class="text-large" style="margin-top: 20px;">We are not just leaving. We are building something new. Something better. This is our manifesto, a declaration of independence from the systems that stifle creativity and exploit artists. We believe in a future where art thrives, free from corporate greed and algorithmic control.</p>

                <h2 class="text-large">User-Centric Payments</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The current "pro-rata" model is broken, a relic designed to benefit platforms, not creators. Your subscription money vanishes into a giant, opaque pot, ultimately subsidizing artists you've never streamed. This system is not only inequitable but actively fosters a "bot economy" where artificial streams dilute genuine engagement. A User-Centric Payment System (UCPS) is the only viable path forward, directly channeling your support to the artists you love. It ensures that every stream counts, reflecting true fan dedication and dismantling the manipulative practices that plague the industry. We are building a future where your money empowers the artists who genuinely move you, fostering a more honest and sustainable ecosystem.</p>

                <h2 class="text-large">Ethical Divestment</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">We categorically demand complete and immediate divestment of corporate funds from entities that profit from oppression and violence. This includes, but is not limited to, military defense technology companies like Helsing, and agencies involved in human rights abuses, such as ICE advertising. Our art is a vessel for connection, empathy, and truth; it will not be co-opted to fund war, surveillance, or systemic injustice. We refuse to allow our creative output to be weaponized or normalized by the military-industrial complex or any institution that undermines human dignity. Our art is for the people, a tool for liberation, not for perpetuating cycles of harm.</p>

                <h2 class="text-large">Artist Safety Net</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The life of an artist is inherently precarious, often devoid of the basic protections afforded to other professions. We advocate for a fundamental shift in how artistic labor is valued and supported: a fixed, transparent percentage of all revenue generated within our ecosystem must be allocated to a collective fund dedicated to artist healthcare and mental health. This safety net is not charity; it is a recognition of the invaluable contribution artists make to society and a necessary countermeasure to the systemic exploitation that leaves many vulnerable. We envision a system that genuinely supports artists, providing security and stability, rather than one that perpetually extracts value while neglecting their well-being.</p>

                <h2 class="text-large">AI Consent</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The rise of generative AI presents both immense potential and profound ethical challenges. We draw a firm line: under no circumstances shall our music, our likenesses, or our creative output be used to train generative AI models without explicit, opt-in consent and equitable compensation. Our creations are extensions of our identity and labor, not raw material for corporate algorithms to ingest without permission or fair remuneration. We will actively fight for robust legal frameworks and technological safeguards that enshrine artists' rights in the age of AI, ensuring that innovation serves humanity and creativity, rather than undermining it through unauthorized appropriation. We will not allow our art to be used to build machines that replace us without our consent.</p>

                <h2 class="text-large">Ownership</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The current digital landscape has stripped artists of fundamental control, often forcing them into exploitative agreements where their own creations are "leased" back to them by powerful tech giants. We demand and will build towards a future where artists unequivocally own their data, their masters, and all intellectual property generated from their work. This is about true sovereignty: artists must be in control of their own careers, their distribution, their monetization, and their narrative. We reject the paradigm of the "digital plantation," where creators are serfs beholden to platforms. We envision a world where ownership empowers artists, fostering genuine independence and self-determination in the digital realm.</p>
