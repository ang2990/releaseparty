                <p class="text-large" style="margin-top: 20px;">This is more than a protest; it is the beginning of a vital new conversation. This movement is about radically re-centering the narrative around artists and their authentic needs and desires, freeing ourselves from the profit-driven incentives of the boring billionaire oligarchs who currently control our art and culture. We refuse to be beholden to their agenda.</p>
